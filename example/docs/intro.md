# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Bright Table in less than 10 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **installing bright table**.


### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new table

We will generate a new table by 
using the bright table react plugin.

First we have to download the bright table package from github using the code below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bright-office/bright-table
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run BrightTable.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open your website when you have displayed the bright table and then you see the rendered table.
